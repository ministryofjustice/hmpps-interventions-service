There are dedicated consultation clinics in each GM Probation Delivery Unit. The process of ongoing assessment and review will contribute to ensuring that drug and alcohol related health needs are met inclusive of those contributing to offending risk.                                                                                       Specific objectives and appropriate interventions will be determined that take full account of complexity in addressing individual drug and alcohol related need, supporting social (re)integration, and enabling people to lead meaningful and purposeful lives.\n\nDependency and Recovery Key Workers will have a thorough understanding of the medical and psycho-social interventions provided by specialist substance misuse services and the thresholds and referral pathways for accessing them.                                                                                 Delivered interventions (1:1 or group) will promote recovery and resilience with the overall aim being to reduce drug and alcohol related harm to the POP and the wider community.",
