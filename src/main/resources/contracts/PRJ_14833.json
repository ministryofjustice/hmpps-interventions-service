  "short_description": "Dependency services to reduce the harmful effects of substance misuse, promote healthier behaviours, and improve overall well-being. Recovery services focus on helping individuals maintain long-term recovery and rebuild their lives after overcoming dependency. Practitioners are requested to utilise the Substance Misuse Screening Tool to inform referrals.  These services provide ongoing support through various interventions, such as individual and group therapy, life skills training, and relapse prevention programs and address the physical, psychological, and social aspects of dependency, providing a comprehensive approach to treatment and recovery.\n\nServices are available for all adult males on probation in South Gloucestershire, who are not subject to an Alcohol Community Treatment Requirement and/or a Drug Community Treatment Requirement and are either: \n\n- on a Community Sentence or Suspended Sentence Order and subject to a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement (RAR) whereby a specified number of RAR Activity Days will be allocated.\n\n- pre-release to people who are convicted. For most cases a pre-release referral will be beneficial to support the person prior to release, by building and maintaining relationships to maximise engagement once released, develop close working relationships with treatment providers and support post release appointments with local substance misuse teams.\n\n- released on licence and post-sentence supervision.\n\nAny Sessions delivered as part of a RAR Activity Day or as a mandated Licence or Post Sentence Supervision appointment will be Enforceable.â€¯\n\nServices are offered as either Low, Medium or High complexity.",
